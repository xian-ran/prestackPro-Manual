# Spectral Decomposition



Pre-Stack Pro allows the user to perform Spectral Decomposition on:

* Stacked Volumes
* Partial Stacked Volumes
* Pre-stack Data, i.e. gathers

Spectral Decomposition is performed on the fly, with the user controlling the frequencies and blending. 

Spectral Decomposition maps can be saved and reopened to reproduce the same RGB blend at a later date. Full volume export of the frequencies is also available.

Any volumes can be used as input to the RGB blend display, e.g. Near, Mid and Far offset volumes.
