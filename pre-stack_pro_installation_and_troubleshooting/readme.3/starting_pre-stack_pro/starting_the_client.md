# Starting the client

To start Pre-Stack Pro, open a terminal window and prompt the following line into your command window:

```bash
/opt/PreStackPro/bin/PreStackPro
```

This command will start Pre-Stack Pro on the client machine, but it can be started from any machine with a direct network access to you master node \(the node where you put the machine file\).

Once Pre-Stack Pro is launched, the backend servers need to be started.
