#### Installing the license file {#installing-the-license-file}

To install the license file, you have two options. You can use the server control tool and import the *.olixml file using the "License Import" tab. You can also import the license file via the web interface. On the server main page, select "Browse..." to navigate to the license file, then click "Import Selected XML". You should see a message informing you of the imported licenses. 

You can also verify the correct import by clicking "View Licenses" on the server main page.

Attention: If you remove the imported licenses using the “Unload” option on the license administration page, you will not be able to re-import them from the same file and will have to request a new license file.
