#### Installing the license file {#installing-the-license-file}

To install the license file, you have two options. You can use the server control tool and import the *.olixml file using the &quot;License Import&quot; tab. You can also import the license file via the web interface. On the server main page, select &quot;Browse...&quot; to navigate to the license file, then click &quot;Import Selected XML&quot;. You should see a message informing you of the imported licenses.

You can also verify the correct import by clicking &quot;View Licenses&quot; on the server main page.

Attention: If you remove the imported licenses using the “Unload” option on the license administration page, you will not be able to re-import them from the same file and will have to request a new license file.
