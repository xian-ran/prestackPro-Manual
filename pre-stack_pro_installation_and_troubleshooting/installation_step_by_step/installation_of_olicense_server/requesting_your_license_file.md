#### Requesting your license file {#requesting-your-license-file}

After you successfully installed the OLicense server, we will require the server&#039;s unique identifier to link your issued license to it. To generate the server&#039;s UUID, you can use the server web interface. Either start a browser from the server control tool via the &quot;Open Browser Frontend&quot; button, or open a web browser and manually enter the server&#039;s address and port number in the form

| http://serveraddress:serverport |
| --- |

For a complete description of the web interface, also consult the server manual.

To create the UUID, select &quot;Administer Server...&quot;. You will be asked for a login and password, which is initially the same login you used to install the server. (If you installed the server as a service, this can be the administrative account you used to aquire root privileges). It is recommended to change this to a new username/password.

On the administration web page, you should see the entry &quot;Preferred Server ID&quot;. The UUID is displayed in the rightmost column. You can use the &quot;Export Server Info...&quot; button to save the information to a file, or you can copy and send us the UUID directly. Please include either the *.olsiml file or the UUID in your license request email. Please send those informations to:

sebastien.denis@sharpreflections.com

After doing so, you will get a *.olixml license file from us.
