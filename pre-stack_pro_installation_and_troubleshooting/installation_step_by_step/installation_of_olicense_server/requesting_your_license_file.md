#### Requesting your license file {#requesting-your-license-file}

After you successfully installed the OLicense server, we will require the server's unique identifier to link your issued license to it. To generate the server's UUID, you can use the server web interface. Either start a browser from the server control tool via the "Open Browser Frontend" button, or open a web browser and manually enter the server's address and port number in the form

For a complete description of the web interface, also consult the server manual.

To create the UUID, select "Administer Server...". You will be asked for a login and password, which is initially the same login you used to install the server. (If you installed the server as a service, this can be the administrative account you used to acquire root privileges). It is recommended to change this to a new username/password.

On the administration web page, you should see the entry "Preferred Server ID". The UUID is displayed in the rightmost column. You can use the "Export Server Info..." button to save the information to a file, or you can copy and send us the UUID directly. Please include either the *.olsiml file or the UUID in your license request email. Please send those information to:

[sebastien.denis@sharpreflections.com](/sebastien.denis@sharpreflections.com)

After doing so, you will get a *.olixml license file from us.
