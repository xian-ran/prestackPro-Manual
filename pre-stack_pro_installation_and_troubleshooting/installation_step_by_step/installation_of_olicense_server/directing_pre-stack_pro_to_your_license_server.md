#### Directing Pre-Stack Pro to your license server {#directing-pre-stack-pro-to-your-license-server}

To enable Pre-Stack Pro to find your license server \(provided itâ€™s not running on your master node on port 80\), you will have to include the address and port of the server in your PreStackProBackendrc file on the master node, located in the etc/ folder of your Pre-Stack Pro installation. Please add the lines to the file.
