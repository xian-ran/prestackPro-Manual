#### Starting the client {#starting-the-client}

To start Pre-Stack Pro, open a terminal window and prompt the following line into your command window:

| /opt/PreStackPro/bin/PreStackPro |
| --- |

This commend will start Pre-Stack Pro on the client machine, but it can be started from any machine with a direct network access to you master node (the node where you put the machine file).

Once Pre-Stack Pro is launched, the backend servers need to be started.
