# Input a volume from the Data Pool in a workflow

A workflow must be already open. When you need, it is possible to drag and drop a volume from the Data pool into an open workflow. This may be empty, or already contain algorithms. Drag the volume into the desired position within the workflow, by dragging it to where it is to be used.

An indentation will appear on the volume to note that this volume comes from the data pool. It is important to note that this type of workflow cannot be saved. This is because the Data pool volumes are in a transient state.
