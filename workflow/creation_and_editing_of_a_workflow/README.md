## Creation and editing of a workflow {#creation-and-editing-of-a-workflow}

In Pre-Stack Pro, it is possible to work interactively on a limited set of data, on the zone of interest, prospect, around a calibration wellâ€¦. Once the processing sequence is determined and suitable parameters are set, all the steps can be recorded and stored in a workflow. The processing sequence can then be applied to the full data set.

The workflow can also be edited and saved.
