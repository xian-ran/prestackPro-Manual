### Create a workflow from volume {#create-a-workflow-from-volume}

It is possible to create a workflow directly from a volume in the Data Pool. This allows the user to work interactively on a set of data, testing and executing the algorithms.

Once the full processing sequence is determined and suitable parameters are set, a workflow containing all the necessary algorithms executed to produce the final volume can be created.

**Right click** on the final result volume and select **Create workflow from this volume**.

It is also possible to highlight **several volumes**, right click away from them and create a workflow from the selected datasets.
