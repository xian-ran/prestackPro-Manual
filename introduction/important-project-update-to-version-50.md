## Important: Project update to 5.0

Several new features related to the new Well Tie module required extensive changes to the project description and data file of Pre-Stack Pro. This means that existing project will have to be converted to the 5.0 project format upon opening.

**Please be aware that converted projects can no longer be opened with earlier release of Pre-Stack Pro.**

**Also, data exported with the version 2.3 or earlier of the Petrel Plug-in cannot be imported to Pre-Stack Pro 5.0 directly. Until the version of the Petrel plug-in is incremented to 2.4 or more, you will need to export to a 4.0 project and use the Shared project functionality to transfer into a 5.0 project.**

When opening an existing project for the first time with Pre-Stack Pro 5.0, a pop up appears informing you that this project needs to be converted. Clicking OK will convert the project and open it, clicking Cancel will do nothing.

For project that are shared with a symbolic link to a master project, both master and shared projects need to be converted. However, the order into which this is done is not important.
