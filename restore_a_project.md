# Restore a project {#restore-a-project}

It is possible to restore a project if it has been corrupted:

**Project** â†’ **Restore Project Data**

This will scan the project for datasets that exist on disk, but are not present in the project configuration file. The data must have been created (or loaded) with Pre-Stack Pro version 4.6.0 or higher.

There are the options to restore or to remove selected items:

**Restore**: This will add the missing data back into the configuration file.

**Remove**: If the datasets are no longer required, then they can be deleted from disk.
