Manage Polygons

These Tabs allow the user to select and **edit** any existing project polygons, to **save** any of these to an ascii text file or **import** polygons by reading ascii files.

Polygons can be saved as inlines/crosslines or as X/Y UTM coordinates (M or Ft)

These can then be imported into or edited in Manage Polygons or in Map View as if they were individual polygons; but are selected for display in the viewers as one combined Pre-Stack Pro polygon.
