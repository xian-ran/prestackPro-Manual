### Picking the live data {#picking-the-live-data}

The first thousand lines of ASCII file are shown beneath the name.

To separate the data into columns, you have to select the first line of live data by clicking with the right mouse-button. A context menu will appear where you can select **Start data import from here**.

A warning can occur if the number of columns is not consistent beyond the selected line. For example, user comments may appear on some lines. These lines should be omitted from the import. In general, only the lines with the same number of columns as the **Start of data** will be imported.

Defining the first line with live data

Having selected the start of the live data, it will be tabulated beneath the file preview based on a user defined column separator.

For each column, a drop down menu is available. This can be used to assign the data type of each columns. Not all columns have to be set. The required columns are different for each file type and indicated in the GUI.

Once this information is provided, the **Import** button will become available. The setup can also be saved as a template. For the next import, the defined template can be selected from the pull-down menu and executed by selecting **Apply Template**.

**Remove Characters from Data:**

Some file formats might contain characters that need to be excluded from the import. By entering them into the **Remove Characters** field and pressing the **Apply** button, all appearances of these characters will be omitted from the live data.

To help you with setting the column definition, the file preview can be opened in a bigger separate window. Click on the button **Show file content window** in the lower left corner of the window.
