## Coordinate Converter {#coordinate-converter}

Available in **Utilities** → **Coordinate Converter**, this small tool is for coordinate conversion between UTM-X/Y and Inline/Crossline. Conversion can be done in both directions and saved into an ASCII file.

Coordinate Converter

The user types the coordinates of one coordinate pair, either in the Inline Position and Crossline Position fields, or in the World X and World Y fields. The results will automatically be computed in the corresponding other fields.

The **Add to Table** button will keep the point positions in the table. The full table can be exported as a tabulated ASCII file using **Export table to file…**
