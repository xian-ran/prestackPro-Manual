## Manage Wells {#manage-wells}

Manage Wells is the central toolbox to create, import, modify and QC well data. The basic properties of the well are setup:

* Coordinates of the well head \(both UTM-X/Y and inline/crossline\)
* KB elevation
* Total measured depth
* UWI
* Content
* Plugged or not

Path, Tops, TD tables, Checkshots and Logs can be imported from there. For details about import I refer to 4.1.6

_Features to create and edit wells in Manage Wells_

In **View T/D tables** or **View CS tables**, one can compare several time-depth relationships. Once one table is selected for display, clicking on **Lock **allows to choose another one to compare with.

By default, all tops are showed in side, top and map viewers when choosing **Display Tops** in the context menu of a well. From **Manage Wells**, one can select which tops will be displayed and create a global list of visible tops.

To do this, **Manage Wells → View Tops → Manage Global Settings**

The ticked-on tops will be visible by default on all displays when tops are showed.
