## View/Compare Probabilities {#view-compare-probabilities}

The View/Compare probabilities Utility displays a set of probabilities at a single inline, crossline location. Tick on the desired volumes, and they are shown in the track to the right. The volumes may be re-ordered by dragging them with the mouse in the volume list, then clicking the Update plot ordering button. A second probability plot may be added to the right of the first by ticking on “Show second probability plot”. This may be used, for example, to compare different PCube runs or to compare the prior and posterior probability cubes. To avoid messy annotation, the cursor readout can be displayed in a separate window by ticking the “Show readouts…” box.
