### Auto/Cross-correlation {#auto-cross-correlation}

Go to **Attributes** â†’ **Auto/Cross-correlation**

Auto-correlation of one volume, gives information about the presence of periodic events, within the time window chosen, for the computation. Cross-correlation of two volumes is a measure of the similarity between them. It will also give a measure of the time-shifts/phase rotation between the two volumes.

_Dialog for auto/cross-correlation_

**Auto-correlation:** if chosen; only one input volume is necessary. When ticked off the algorithm will perform a cross-correlation and a **Second Input Volume **must be chosen. The geometry of both volumes must be identical, except that it is possible to choose a stack volume and a pre-stack volume. If so, the trace for one location of the stack volume is correlated with all traces of the pre-stack volume at the same location.

**Lead and Lag:** values in seconds, they must be less than the input trace length.

**Time Selection:** it can be constant times or bounded by a Polygon Selection. it can be constant times or bounded by a Polygon Selection.

**Normalize:** scales the results so that the maximum value is equal to 1

**Taper:** linear time tapering at the top and bottom of the time window

**Unbiased Correlation Window:** when ticked on, values outside the time window are set to 0.
