### Volume Calculator {#volume-calculator}

With the **Volume Calculator** you can perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, adding noise and scale your amplitude.

Go to:

**Attributes** → **Volume Calculator**

This tool is extremely useful to determine the impact of a process on the data, what has been removed, changed, or added.

This process is composed of 3 parts:

The first part is called **input I**. This input is always supposed to be a volume from the Data Pool.

**The method selection:** It can be either an arithmetic operation \(+, -, \*, /\), noise addition or an amplitude limiting tool as well as angle functions \(sin, cos, tan, arc sin…\)

Some of the functions are only available for certain inputs, e.g. logarithm is only available for volumes with values >= 0.

**The input II** part is sensitive to the selected method. For the arithmetic methods, input can be either another volume or a constant scalar value. The scalar value can be typed in using scientific notation.
