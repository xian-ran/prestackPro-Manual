### Geometric Properties {#geometric-properties}

Curvature attributes can be computed from **Attributes** â†’ **Geometric Properties.**

**Input:** These are surface attributes; possible inputs are horizons or 3D (post-stack) volumes. In the case of a 3D volume computation, attributes will be performed time slice by time slice.

Curvature attributes are computed inside a 3x3 stencil traveling in the inline and crossline directions. Within each position, a second order polynomial (quadratic) surface will be fitted to the data and will be used to derive attributes from analytical expressions. This approach does not require any user parameters.

**Outputs:**

*   **Maximum curvature:** This attribute is very effective in delimiting faults and faults geometry. Faults in the figure are represented by the superposition of maximum and minimum curvatures.
*   **Minimum curvature:** Similar to the maximum curvature.
*   **Most positive curvature:** First order derivative attribute useful for detecting edges associated with assymetric (faults) and symmetric (ridges/valleys) surface features.
*   **Most negative curvature:** similar to the most positive curvature.
*   **Dip angle:** Angle, with repect to the horizontal, of the maximum dip.
*   **Azimuth:** Angle giving the orientation, with respect to Inline direction, of the maximum dip.
