# Output Setup

In the Output Setup tab, the output prefix must be specified, and the time window for the inversion defined. The Pcube+ user can toggle on which volumes/cubes/horizons to be outputted from the inversion.

The figure below shows the Output Setup interface. The default parameters for the output selection are shown. It is possible to select either start time or a horizon as the Window start.

The inversion is started by clicking on the **Start PCube** button.
