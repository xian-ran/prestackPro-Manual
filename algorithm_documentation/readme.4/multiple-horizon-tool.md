# Multiple Horizon Tool

Multiple Horizon Tools is designed to fill holes in horizons and fix crossing errors to generate complete grids for input to CRAVA and PCube+, in addition to general interpretation use.

Multiple Horizon Tool is in the Interpretation-Processing menu and when launched opens an Add Horizons menu. Select the horizons as required, these can be changed later. Input horizons can be: manually picked horizons, autotracked horizons, a combination of 3Dautotracking and manual picks, or grids. The tool works with time or depth horizons, but not prestack surfaces.

Once loaded, horizons are listed in a table, with the highlighted horizon displayed in the Map window. To change the map display, click on a different horizon in the table.

The input horizons are automatically analysed for holes and if they cross each other. The results are listed in the table. The thickness ratio \(min isochron thickness / max isochron thickness\) is automatically calculated and is listed in the table.

Additional horizons can be added to the table. Horizons can also be removed from the table.

The **checking area** defines the lateral extent of the gridding process and can be manually set using inline and crossline ranges or set to match a volume in the project \(e.g. a seismic volume to be used in CRAVA\).

The section view displays the horizons in a vertical display as either an inline, crossline or arbitrary path. Horizons can be togged on/off in the table, they can also be removed and additional horizons loaded from the project. To change the colour of a horizon click on the colour icon in the table.
