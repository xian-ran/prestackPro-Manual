# Use Cases

**Initial quality control** \(see example below\) 

* Overview of available Wells and Log Data Quick
* Overview of Initial Well Tie 
* Access individual Well Tie 
* Save Well Tie 
* Track improvement in well tie QC graphs

![Example: Overview and Initial quality Control](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

**Well Tie QC for different conditioned seismic:**   
Change input seismic to observe if well ties improve after a conditioning step has been applied



Estimate wavelets in all wells and **select wavelets as input for average wavelet:** 

* Wavelets need to be estimated on a well by well basis 
* Save Well Ties and update plots 
* Select the best wavelets from table for PCA averaging

Note that History of Averaged wavelets are currently not supported. Only PCA averaging is currently available as Multi-Well Wavelet proxy
