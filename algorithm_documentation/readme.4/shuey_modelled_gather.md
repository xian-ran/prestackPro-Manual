# Shuey Modelled gather

This algorithm will generate a synthetic dataset using Shuey equation. The input should be a Gradient volume and an Intercept volume \(Curvature volume is optional\), all of the same geometry. The output will be angle gathers, of the same dimension as the AVA attributes input volumes for Inlines, Crosslines and time. The angle axis will be defined by the parameters Angle Min, Angle Max and Step.
