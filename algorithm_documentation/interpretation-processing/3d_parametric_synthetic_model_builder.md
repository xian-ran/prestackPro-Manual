_3D synthetic gather volume, created from a single initial 1D reference model, showing amplitudes varying with porosity & angle (crossline) and reservoir layer thickness (inline)._

This application allows the user to input anything from a simple 1D $$Vp_,V_s$$ and  Rho log model to a complex, multi-axes, multi-layer, property change, “parametric”, $$Vp_,V_s$$ and Rho 3D volume model; from which a single synthetic gather to a whole pre-stack volume can be calculated. It allows 1D single gather, 2D line cross section, 3D and 4D volume synthetic models to be created.  ( 4D = 3D + a $$2^{nd}$$ offset/azimuth axis )

These extra dimensions are used to show “parametric changes” only and cannot be used to model 3D geological structure. They allow the user to make 100’s of synthetic gather models in one execution of the application and store them all together in one pre-stack dataset. 

These synthetic gather datasets give the user quick and effective insights into their reservoir gather character and AVA expression. For example, they can be used to investigate how AVO amplitude changes with the $$Vp_,V_s$$ and density of the reservoir and caprock; with fluid substitution and with bed thickness.
