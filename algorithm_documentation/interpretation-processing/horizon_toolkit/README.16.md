### Horizon Toolkit {#horizon-toolkit}

The horizon toolkit is designed for creating and manipulating horizons.

It features a 3D Auto-tracker that allows fast and easy tracking of stacked horizons from seed points. This has dedicated editing tools that includes an interactive polygon deletion; the locking of QC’d point-sets; and the delineation of “parent-child” relationships for any tracked point.

The horizon toolkit also has the ability to extend stacked horizons to pre-stack data by snapping and tracking the horizons onto gathers.

It contains gridding and de-spiking algorithms for post-processing of tracked or imported horizons.

To open up the horizon toolkit go to:

**Interpretation-Processing** → **Horizon Tool**

Many of the processes available in the horizon toolkit will exploit pre-defined horizons. To make these accessible, go to the **Add Horizon** drop down menu, select, and then **Add** the relevant horizon. The horizon will in the dialog box above, with a list of properties associated with the horizon.

By default, up to 5 horizons to be available in the toolkit at any one time. This can be increased by changing the **Keep Last** value.

Left click on the  ![](/assets/108_Interpretation.png)   icon to synchronize it to a chosen map, stack or gather viewer. The viewer will update when new horizons are created.

The user has the option to save these new horizons to the project by right clicking on the horizon name. Other options include “show the used parameters”, and “set to New/Overwrite mode”.
