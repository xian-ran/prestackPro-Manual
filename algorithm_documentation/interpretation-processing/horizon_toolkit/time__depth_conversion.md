_Time / depth Conversion_

Choose the horizon you wish to convert. Select the appropriate interval velocity field and then click calculate. If the input horizon is in the time domain it will convert to depth and vice-versa. 

Note: If the horizon tool is synchronized to a 2D viewer, then the output may not be visible. This is because the viewer itself is in the original domain. It will be necessary to open up a second 2D viewer to QC the results.
