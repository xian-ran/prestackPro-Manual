#### Pcube+ Inspector {#pcube-inspector}

The **Pcube+ Inspector** is a separate graphical user interface where output data from a Pcube+ inversion can be loaded for detailed inspection. The layout is very similar to the Parameter Testing window. The user is referred to the section on Parameter Tuning for details.

Go to **Interpretation-Processing** â†’ **Pcube+ Inspector**

The figure below shows the Pcube+ Inspector when loaded with output data from an inversion.
