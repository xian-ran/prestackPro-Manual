### Shuey Modelled gather {#shuey-modelled-gather}

This algorithm will generate a synthetic dataset using Shuey equation. The input should be a Gradient volume and an Intercept volume, both of the same geometry. The output will be angle gathers, of the same dimension as the AVA attributes input volumes for Inlines, Crosslines and time. The angle axis will be defined by the parameters Angle Min, Angle Max and Step.
