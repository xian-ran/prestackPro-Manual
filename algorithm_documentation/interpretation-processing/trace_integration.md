### Trace Integration {#trace-integration}

This algorithm computes a cumulative sum of the amplitude followed by a mean filter to remove DC Bias. The Window Size parameter is the mean filter length. The algorithm inputs a pre-stack or stack Seismic Amplitude volume. 

It is a relative impedance attribute similar to SAIL log
