### Seismic Tab {#seismic-tab}

* **Input Seismic:** Seismic data loaded into the **Data Pool** is available from the pull-down menu or picked using the dropper icon. Stack or pre-stack seismic can be used.
* **Stack Angle** is the angle used to generate a synthetic for stacked seismic. For pre-stack seismic the angle is used to make a seismic section and can be changed within the Well Tie window.
* **Inline/Crossline half-length** is the extent of the seismic sub-volume loaded into Well Tie. 
* **Deviated wells** can be verticalized. If treated as deviated, seismic data will be extracted along the well path providing the area where the well-path intersects the seismic volume contains more than 6 CDPs.
