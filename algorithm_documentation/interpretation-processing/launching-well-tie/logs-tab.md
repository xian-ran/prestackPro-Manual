### Logs Tab {#logs-tab}

* Logs can be individually selected or loaded as a group that is saved in a **Log Set**. A Log Set can be created in **Utilities &gt; Manage Log Sets**.
* A **$$V_s$$ log** is required for tying pre-stack seismic. If no $$V_s$$ is present a zero-incidence synthetic gather will be generated for a stacked well tie.
* Toggle on **Edit Logs** to filter the logs if required.
