### Wavelet Extraction & Editing {#wavelet-extraction-&-editing}

A wavelet is required to generate a synthetic. In a virgin project, with no previously generated wavelet, a Ricker wavelet is created during initialisation of Well Tie. The user then has the option of creating alternative synthetic wavelets, extracting a statistical wavelet from the seismic data or extracting a wavelet using both seismic and well data using the Roy White method. All wavelets can be edited with post processing functions. The synthetic in the main Well Tie window can be updated at any point with a new wavelet; the name of the current wavelet is shown in the top left-hand side of the main window. Again, Cross-Correlation quantifies the well tie, with the option of updating the phase of the current wavelet.
