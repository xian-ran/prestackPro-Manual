### Checkshot Calibration {#checkshot-calibration}

The first stage in performing a well tie is to generate a robust time to depth transformation that integrates the checkshot with the well log data.
The Checkshot Calibration window allows the user to edit the checkshots, calibrate the sonic log, and generate a drift curve. The result is a Time-Depth table that is applied to the synthetic. The goodness-of-fit between the synthetic and the seismic is quantified in Cross-Correlation, where bulk shift changes to the TD table can be made.
