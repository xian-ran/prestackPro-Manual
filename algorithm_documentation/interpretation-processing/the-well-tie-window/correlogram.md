### Correlogram {#correlogram}

The correlogram is a sliding window cross-correlation for a single angle plane. For pre-stack seismic the angle is defined in the bottom left-hand side of the main window and can be changed by the user.  
The vertical axis is the centre of the rolling time window, and the horizontal axis is the correlation lag.

**Configuration **enables you to change the data selected \(e.g. choose a different $$V_p$$ log or seismic volume\).   
**Saving a session** will save the current display and the data selection. Multiple sessions may be saved with different names.  
**Save** gives the user the option to save specific groups of data or individual items \(including T/D tables and wavelets\) into the project.
