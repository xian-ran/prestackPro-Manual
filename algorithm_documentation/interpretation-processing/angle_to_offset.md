### Angle to offset {#angle-to-offset}

Angle to Offset complements the existing [Offset to Angle](offset_to_angle.md) routine, so the user can now go from offset to angles and back to offsets.

Go to:

**Interpretation Processing** â†’ **Angle to Offset**

The window display and parameters are similar to the one in [offset to angle.](offset_to_angle.md)
