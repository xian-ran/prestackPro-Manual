### Attenuation {#attenuation}

Seismic data gets attenuated as the energy is transmitted through the earth. One effect is that high frequencies are lost and the other that the phase is changed.

This process can be used to apply processing to seismic data to remove those effects or it can be used to introduce those effects into model traces derived from well-log data.
