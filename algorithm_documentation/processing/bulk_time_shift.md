The algorithm will apply either a constant time shift or a map of time shifts to the input volume. A positive time shift value means that traces go down, a negative one traces go up. We recommend to use Sinc interpolation for seismic or oscillatory volumes and linear for attributes with a strong low frequency component such as velocity. The extrapolation will either fill with 0 values or extend the first/last samples.
