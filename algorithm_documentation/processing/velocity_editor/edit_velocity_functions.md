#### Edit velocity functions {#edit-velocity-functions}

To switch to Edit mode, either click on the ![](/assets/074_Processing.png)  icon or right click on the function inside the semblance spectrum and choose Edit Velocity Function.

The control nodes become bold and you can manipulate them by:

* Moving them
* Adding a new control node by clicking Ctrl + Left mouse button
* Deleting them by a right click and Remove Control Point in the menu

If you click on the icon ![](/assets/075_Processing.png)  it toggles on the time selection. Draw a rectangle inside the semblance spectrum to select several control points at once. A right click will then show the option to Delete All Selected Points. You need to be in Edit mode.

The NMO gathers update in real time for every change done on the velocity function.

If you are at a location without a function, you will see a velocity curve interpolated from the neighboring function. This curve will be of the color grey, irrespective of the color chosen for the Velocity Function object. Editing this curve will automatically create a function for that location.

When you have finished, you can save the function \(with a new name or overwrite the current one\) by clicking on the relevant icons. You can also create a velocity volume from the functions by clicking on the icon ![](/assets/076_Processing.png) .
