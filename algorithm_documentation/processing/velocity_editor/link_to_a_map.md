_Some functions have a green status, meaning they have been reviewed._

The icon ![](/assets/080_Processing.png)  for selection lets you select all velocity functions inside a rectangle and delete them or edit them \(**Manipulated All Selected Points**\). This is useful for deleting all functions inside a spatial anomaly, visible on a velocity time slice, for example.

If you choose Edit Selected Functions, you can set a constant interval velocity in a window defined by constant times and/or horizons.
