### Edit Mode {#edit-mode}

Any volume which is the output of an algorithm can be edited. Right-click on the volume in the Data Pool â†’ the context menu will show an entry **Edit algorithm parameter.**

The algorithm window will open and the user can change all parameters, apart from the input volume and the choice of optional outputs. Parameters that change the size of the output volume, such as the angle range in Offset to Angle, can also be changed. Clicking **Calculate **will close the window and overwrite the output volumes. Clicking **Apply **will leave the window open and overwrite the output volumes.

The context menu has an entry called **Edit Copy**. This will open a copy of the algorithm window. The user can change all parameters, including the input volume and optional output choices. This will create new volumes that can be easily compared to the originals.
