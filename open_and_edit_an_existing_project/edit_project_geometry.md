## Edit project geometry {#edit-project-geometry}

If modifications are needed in the project geometry please open the project. [Open project](open_project.md)

Then go to **Project** â†’ **edit project geometry**.

The Show| edit project geometry will open and modification can be done. This window is very similar to the one discussed in the chapter [create project](..\create_a_new_project.md).
