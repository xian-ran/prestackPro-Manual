### Open shared project and transfer data {#open-shared-project-and-transfer-data}

Go to **Project** → **File Manager** and click on the icon ![](/assets/011_file_manager.png) “open shared project”. The file manager will be spilt into two sections, one for the original project and one for the newly created one.

_File Manager for Shared Projects_

To transfer data from one to another project, select the volumes by checking their tick-boxes and click on the blue arrow in the central part of the window that corresponds to the correct direction _from..to_.

By design it is possible to transfer data between projects that do not have the same geometry. However, the user should be aware that the correspondence between World coordinates and project grid coordinates might not be correct anymore.
