# Format definition

The ASCII importer assumes that:

* Each line represents a data point
* A data point cannot be described over several lines \(except for LAS format\)
* Each data point has a location information

There is a separator between each field. This can be a particular character \(for example a comma\), meaning CSV files are easily read in Pre-Stack Pro. It can also be spaces, so tabulated files can also be read.
