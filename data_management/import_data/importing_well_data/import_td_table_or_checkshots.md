### Import T/D table or Checkshots {#import-t-d-table-or-checkshots}

If you did not import time values when the well path was imported, you can do this by either **Project** → **Import Wells** → **Import Well T/D tables** (or **Checkshots**)or simply do this from **Utilities** → **Manage Wells**. It is possible to associate several T/D tables and checkshots to a given well.

To import time-depth data or checkshot data select **Import T/D table** or **Import Checkshots**. The process of picking live data is equal as for importing well path. Only columns with TvD and Two Way Time are required. Make sure that time is picked with correct unit (second or millisecond).

**Additional Parameters:**

Make sure that the **Directly use this to convert path from depth to time** is selected.

**View T/D table** or **Checkshots:**

The imported time values can be viewed for QC by clicking **View T/D Tables** or **View CS tables**. True vertical depth and corresponding time values are listed in a table. Distance units can be selected as meters or Feet. If more than one T/D tables (or checkshots) are associated with the well, one of them must be selected and set as active.
