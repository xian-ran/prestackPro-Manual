_Manage Polygons_

These Tabs allow the user to select and **edit** any existing project polygons, to **save** any of these to an ascii text file or **import** polygons by reading ascii files.

Polygons can be saved as inlines/crosslines or as X/Y UTM coordinates \(M or Ft\)

Polygons can also be read and imported from an ascii text file as inlines/crosslines or as X/Y UTM coordinates \(M or Ft\)

A new, empty polygon file is first created in the Pre-Stack Pro project, using the top Manage Polygon menu icons, and then the MB3 context menu allows “Read from file”.

Several polygon ascii files can be imported together and made into one single polygon inside your Pre-Stack Pro project.

To import 3 polygons into a single Pre-Stack Pro polygon below; the user uses the green **+** add button to make 3 “sub-polygons” – Polygon0, Polygon1, Polygon2 which are shown in vertical Tabs.

These can then be imported into or edited in Manage Polygons or in Map View as if they were individual polygons; but are selected for display in the viewers as one combined Pre-Stack Pro polygon.
