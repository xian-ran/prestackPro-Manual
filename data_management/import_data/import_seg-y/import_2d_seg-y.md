# Import 2D SEG-Y

To import 2D SEG-Y go to:

**Project** → **Import Data** → **Import 2D SEG-Y**

You can import a single 2D line, or multiple 2D lines at the same time. If you import several lines, Pre-Stack Pro will create one volume per line.

The key selection is slightly different than for 3D SEG-Y.

The following keys are required:

* Line number
* CDP number
* World-X and World-Y coordinates
* Fold

An arbitrary path is created for each 2D line. This is located at the corresponding UTM X and Y positions. It allows you to display a base map with the 2D lines position in a Map Viewer.
