# Shared Projects

The shared project algorithm will create a new empty project based on an existing one by taking the same geometry and CRS information. It also provides the possibility to transfer data between two projects without having to go through the import/export steps. There is a tick box to create **symbolic link** to the files in the shared project rather than copy the files. If a volume is a symbolic link it will have a dedicated icon for easier recognition.

This way, several users can work on forked versions of the same project and exchange volumes in a very efficient way. Itâ€™s also for instance useful if you want to create a much smaller project to keep working on a laptop.
