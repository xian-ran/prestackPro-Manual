# Delete data

To delete a volume from the project, go to the file manager. On the data tree, toggle on the data to delete. Then click on the delete button ![](../../.gitbook/assets/002_file_manager.png) at the top of this window. Multiple datasets can also be selected for deletion.

_Delete data_

If the data you want to delete has been imported from SEG-Y and the Headers associated with it are stored, the File Manager will warn you that those Headers will be deleted together with the seismic data.

Deleting Arbitrary Paths: If you choose to delete a locked Arbitrary Path, the File Manager will also propose to delete any existing children.
