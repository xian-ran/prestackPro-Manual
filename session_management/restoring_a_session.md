## Restoring a session {#restoring-a-session}

Go to **Project** â†’ **Restore Session**.

A window pops up with the list of all volumes in the session, proposing to restore only the volumes or both volumes and viewers. The user can deselect one or several volumes he does not wish to restore. Viewers are restored in the same state and settings as they were when the session was saved, except for synchronization.
