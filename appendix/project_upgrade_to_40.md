# Project upgrade to 4.0

Pre-Stack Pro version 4.0 and superior make significant changes to project files and directory structures, and requires an upgrade to all existing configuration \(.xml\) files. After the upgrade, there is no back compatibility of projects from the 4.X version to the previous 4 X.

To upgrade your project, simply open it in the 4.X version. Before this conversion starts, a warning will pop up in Pre-Stack Pro confirming that you wish to proceed.

If you want to use your project with previous versions, before converting it please copy the project file \(config\_PreStackPro.xml\) and rename it e.g. config\_PreStackPro\_38.xml. This configuration file can be used to open the project in the previous version. However, new data created or imported in the 4.X version will not be available.
