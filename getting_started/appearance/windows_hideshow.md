### Windows hide/show {#windows-hide-show}

For more flexibility, all the windows can be hidden. This will optimize the working space accordingly to your need. To hide (or show) a window, go to **windows**.

The last item of the menu called **Window list** will open a small window listing all open/minimized windows in the software, in order for you to quickly retrieved any hidden window. Those can be sorted either by type or by activation time. If you double-click on one of the window name, the relevant window will appear in front of all the ones currently open. This window list stays in front of all other viewers.

If you have closed one window by mistake, you can retrieve it from here.
