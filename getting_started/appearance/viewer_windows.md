\#\#\# Viewer windows {\#viewer-windows}

Pre-Stack Pro has different data viewers for displaying data loaded into the software:

* The [3D  Viewer](/viewers\3d_viewers\README.2.md) Window allows you to display your data stack or prestack in a 3D environment.
* Gather Viewer enables visualisation of any size pre-stack volume a panel of gathers. Several cubes can be displayed as long as their geometry is consistant. Horizons and wells can also be displayed
* Stack Viewer enables visualisation of stacked or constant offset/angle data. Several cubes can be displayed as long as their geometry is consistant. Horizons and wells can also be displayed
* Map viewer is a visualization tool to display maps as well as stacked volumes and horizons. The data is shown north oriented with a little compass indicating directions.
* Pre-stack map viewer displays prestack volumes at a user-defined time/depth as well as maps created from a prestack volume. Time/depth information from a horizon can be displayed in form of contour lines \(iso lines\) on top of the data.

Other QC window are available for more specialized tasks. These include the [2D volume inspector](..\..\viewers\2d_data_comparator\README.4.md) for single-gather amplitude analysis, a [spectral analysis](..\..\viewers\spectral_analysis.md) tool, a [well log](..\..\viewers\well_log_viewer\README.12.md) viewer and [crossplots](..\..\viewers\cross_plot.md) viewer.
