### Viewer windows {#viewer-windows}

Pre-Stack Pro has different data viewers for displaying data loaded into the software:

* The [3D Viewer](../../viewers/3d_viewers/README.2.md) Window allows you to display your data stack or prestack in a 3D environment.
* [Gather Viewer](../../viewers/2d_gather_viewer/README.7.md) enables visualisation of any size pre-stack volume a panel of gathers. Several cubes can be displayed as long as their geometry is consistant. Horizons and wells can also be displayed
* [Stack Viewer](../../viewers/stack_viewer/README.8.md) enables visualisation of stacked or constant offset/angle data. Several cubes can be displayed as long as their geometry is consistant. Horizons and wells can also be displayed
* [Map viewer](../../viewers/2d_map_viewer/README.6.md) is a visualization tool to display maps as well as stacked volumes and horizons. The data is shown north oriented with a little compass indicating directions.
* [Pre-stack map viewer](../../viewers/2d_prestack_map_viewer.md) displays prestack volumes at a user-defined time/depth as well as maps created from a prestack volume. Time/depth information from a horizon can be displayed in form of contour lines \(isolines\) on top of the data.

Other QC window are available for more specialized tasks. These include the [2D volume inspector](../../viewers/2d_data_comparator/README.4.md) for single-gather amplitude analysis, a [spectral analysis](../../viewers/spectral_analysis.md) tool, a [well log viewer](../..\viewers/well_log_viewer7README.12.md) and [crossplots](../../viewers/cross_plot.md) viewer.
