### Horizons {#horizons}

You can add horizons by drag and drop from the Data Pool.

Using the Cutting Planes tab, you can restrict the inline/crossline extents of these horizons.

To see any horizon projected onto the seismic, go to ‘**Sync with**’ under the Cutting Planes tab. Select the volume you want to display the horizon on and it appears as a line on the seismic.

You can also make a vertical shift of the horizon under the ‘**Shift in z-direction’**.
