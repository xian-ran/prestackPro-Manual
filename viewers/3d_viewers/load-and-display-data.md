In the Data items field, seismic volumes, horizons and well can be managed. Click on the eye icon to hide or unhide data. All windows inside the 3D viewer can be adjusted or hidden by dragging the border lines vertically or horizontally.

If you have loaded several volumes into the viewer, the one on the top of the list will be visible, in front. To make a volume visible, in front, right click and select ‘Move to top’ from the pop-up menu. You can also use the short cuts noted in the pop-up. In this way, you can quickly flip the view between volumes.

From the same menu, you can also set rotation center and remove the object. Set rotation center means that that the mid-point of your selected object will be the rotation center.
