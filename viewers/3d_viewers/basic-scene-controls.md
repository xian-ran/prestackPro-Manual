### Basic scene controls {#basic-scene-controls}

Scrolling through panels \(inlines, crosslines, time slices\) is done using the slider bars – inline location , time min/max range, angle/offset plane and any viewed gather properties if &lt;view gather&gt; is ticked on.

The mouse controls for rotation, pan and zoom.

Another way of scrolling is through the volume directly from the display using the mouse button. You can use the mouse to select a plane \(C+LMB\), then scroll through the plane with \(SHIFT+LMB\). Rotation axes can also be fixed by holding the X/Y and Z keys.

A left mouse double click turns the GUI on/off enabling the largest possible 3D scene to be viewed and captured for reports and documentation. A click on the ‘cursor readout’ icon from the top of the viewer, and then on an object using control left mouse button, will display a colour 3D crosshair and another blue box with location information in it.

The camera control, projection mode and scene stretching options are available on a tab at the bottom of the 3D viewer, either by using camera icons or icons to see specifically \(inline, crossline, timeslice\).

Users can define and saved user defined cameras view, which can be retrieved during the session or in new session \(within the same project\). This option allows the user to do the same screen grab for instance.
