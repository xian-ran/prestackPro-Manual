### Basic scene controls {#basic-scene-controls}

The mouse controls for rotation, pan and zoom have been kept the same as for the first Pre-Stack Pro 3D viewer.

On the main window of the 3D viewer, a set of icons are accessible ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons.JPG)  
The first two ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons1.JPG) are show/hide the side and bottom panels, the third one ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons2.JPG) to set the background colour.  
The fourth one ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons3.JPG) is to show/hide the bounding box. The next one ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons4.JPG) enables the cursor readout mode.  
The following one ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons5.JPG) hides/shows the North arrow.  
A click on the help ![](/assets/3dviewer_icons6.JPG) from the top of the viewer \(or pressing the ‘H’ key\) pops up the list of basic controls: ![](/assets/3dviewer_shortcuts.JPG)



The left mouse button rotates, the middle \(wheel\) zooms and the right pans. Selected panels – inline, crossline, timeslice and box sides, can be moved using control and left mouse button.  
 A left mouse double click turns the GUI on/off enabling the largest possible 3D scene to be viewed and captured for reports and documentation.. A click on the ‘cursor readout’ icon from the top of the viewer, and then on an object using control left mouse button, will display a colour 3D crosshair and another blue box with location information in it. In this case the seismic value \(-2350.6\) at inline 27534, crossline 16419 and time 1.94817.

The camera control, projection mode and scene stretching options are also kept from the earlier 3D viewer. However, there are 2 rotation centre setting camera options now in the middle – the left hand camera is a «centre on current object» and the right hand camera is a «centre on entire scene».  The default sets rotation on the user selected object.
