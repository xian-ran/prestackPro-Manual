### Basic scene controls {#basic-scene-controls}

The mouse controls for rotation, pan and zoom have been kept the same as for the first Pre-Stack Pro 3D viewer.

A click on the help ‘?’ from the top of the viewer \(or pressing the ‘H’ key\) pops up the list of basic controls shown in the blue box. The left mouse button rotates, the middle \(wheel\) zooms and the right pans. Selected panels – inline, crossline, timeslice and box sides, can be moved using control and left mouse button.  
 A left mouse double click turns the GUI on/off enabling the largest possible 3D scene to be viewed and captured for reports and documentation.. A click on the ‘cursor readout’ icon from the top of the viewer, and then on an object using control left mouse button, will display a colour 3D crosshair and another blue box with location information in it. In this case the seismic value \(-2350.6\) at inline 27534, crossline 16419 and time 1.94817.

The camera control, projection mode and scene stretching options are also kept from the earlier 3D viewer. However, there are 2 rotation centre setting camera options now in the middle – the left hand camera is a «centre on current object» and the right hand camera is a «centre on entire scene».  The default sets rotation on the user selected object.
