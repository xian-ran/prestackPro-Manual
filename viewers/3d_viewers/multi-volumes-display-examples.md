### Multi volumes display examples {#multi-volumes-display-examples}

The first example has two pre-stack gather volumes, with different inline/crossline dimensions, each in their own box, being compared by sliding one across the other. The raw data is covered by the conditioned data which is showing on the left of the display. The data for angle 25 is being compared.

_Two overlapping pre-stack seismic boxes, with three horizons displayed on the conditioned and one on the raw data – The inline slider moves the conditioned over the raw seismic like drawing a curtain_

The second example has three seismic volumes, with different inline/crossline/offset/angle dimensions, with four horizons overlain. The conditioned angle gathers are displayed with inline/crossline/timeslice panels, the PCube Vp stack with a box and the well synthetic gather as a single trace inline panel. Each seismic volume has it’s own histogram set and the PCube Vp stack box has been reduced to just around the well location. The result is a good 3D view for showing the data to the rest of the team or for management/partner meetings.
