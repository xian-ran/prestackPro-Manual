* In the **Cutting planes** tab you are able to quickly pan through the inlines, crosslines and time slices. You can click on the small arrows \(up and down\), type a number directly or just click inside the typing field and then use the mouse wheel to scroll to increasing or decreasing numbers. If you in addition press and hold the control button, scrolling will be decimated and go quicker. The ‘Locking distance’ option will lock the selected number of inlines/crosslines. This can be useful if you want to create a ‘thin’ seismic box \(consisting of minimum 2 lines\) that you can pan back and forth.

When pre-stack gathers are loaded in the viewer, it is also possible to pan through the offset planes from each gather.

* In the **Scene Stretching** tab you can change the aspect ratio in inline, crossline and time direction.
