### Horizon display {#horizon-display}

Horizons can be selected from the list on the bottom left. Horizons are displayed with their own colour and headlight shading only.  
If horizons have a lot of points, they may take a while to load, and check the top right corner for the loading . It is currently not possible to know how long the process will last.

In the current version, pre-stack horizons can NOT be displayed in the 3D viewer. This is work in progress.

Any selected horizon, can be snapped or cropped, to display only on the sides of any vertical seismic objects; one at a time, or all at once, ~~using the ‘All Scene Objects’ option.~~

This Snap to allows users to QC tracked horizons on the seismic data directly.

However, only horizons given a name and saved into the project are available in the list for display. So  Q.C. of tracking is not fully interactive with this first version of the new 3D viewer.

You can add horizons by drag and drop from the Data Pool.

Using the Cutting Planes tab, you can restrict the inline/crossline extents of these horizons.

To see any horizon projected onto the seismic, go to ‘**Sync with**’ under the Cutting Planes tab. Select the volume you want to display the horizon on and it appears as a line on the seismic.

You can also make a vertical shift of the horizon under the ‘**Shift in z-direction’**.
