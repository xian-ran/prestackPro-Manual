### Horizon display {#horizon-display}

Horizons can be selected from the list on the bottom left. If the horizons have a lot of points, they may take a while to load, please be a little patient. Horizons are displayed with their own colour and headlight shading only.

Any selected horizon, can be snapped or cropped, to display only on the sides of any vertical seismic objects; one at a time, or all at once, using the ‘All Scene Objects’ option.

This Snap to allows users to Q.C. tracked horizons on the seismic data directly.

However, only horizons given a name and saved into the project are available in the list for display. So  Q.C. of tracking is not fully interactive with this first version of the new 3D viewer.
