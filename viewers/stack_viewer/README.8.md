## Stack Viewer {#stack-viewer}

The functionalities are basically similar between the Gather Viewer and the Stack Viewer. The purpose of this window is to view stacked seismic constant offset/angle plane. If you select prestack as input, you will only see one offset (or angle) planes. The plane you are looking at can be changed by clicking the up and down arrows at the **Offsets** field.
