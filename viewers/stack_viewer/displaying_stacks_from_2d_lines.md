### Displaying stacks from 2D lines {#displaying-stacks-from-2d-lines}

Stacks from 2D lines are displayed in the same way as stacks from 3D data. But the World X and Y coordinates are displayed instead of inline/crossline values.

Since version 4.6, in the Cursor Read Out window the Inline/Crossline parameters are present showing the World X and Y coordinates. In a future release these will be changed to line number and CDP number.![](/assets/004_stack_viewer.png)
