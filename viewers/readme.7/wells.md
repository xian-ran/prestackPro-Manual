# Wells

All wells in the project are available. Use the toggle box \(open eye\) to make them visible. To change the color of display, right click on the horizon and select the color desired. When the well path is displayed in front of the seismic, it will appear as a thick line. When it is behind the seismic it appears as a thin line.
