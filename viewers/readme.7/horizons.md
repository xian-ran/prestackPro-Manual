# Horizons

All horizons imported into the project will be available in the gather view. The display of the horizons is managed by the toggle box in front of them. An ‘open eye’ symbol appears. The first time a horizon is displayed, there can be a few seconds of lag before it appears. To change the color of display, right click on the horizon and select the color desired.
