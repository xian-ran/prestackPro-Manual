# Arbitrary lines

Arbitrary lines can be selected from the Tool bar. Note that the line will be interactively updated when the line-points are edited from the Map Viewer. If you synchronize the Gather Viewer with the Map Viewer, clicking on ‘CDP Positions’ will enable tracking the line position when you are zooming in the seismic display.
