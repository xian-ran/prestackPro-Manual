### Polygons {#polygons}

Polygons can be used to create mask volumes for Cross-plotting, or to show locations and outlines on maps. To create and edit a polygon, follow instructions as below. You will have the option to create a square polygon or a free-form one.

Once the polygon is created, it shows up in the lower left corner of the map viewer or of the crossplot viewer. By clicking on the item, you can activate/de-activate and change color.

By right clicking on the polygon, you can enter the edit mode. As for arbitrary lines, the corner points will be highlighted and you can easily move the corners and edges as instructed in the figure \(Editing instructions will pop-up first time you create the polygon\). Note that the polygon can be defined as exclusive \(exclude data points\). See figure below.
