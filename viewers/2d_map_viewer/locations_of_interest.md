### Locations of Interest {#locations-of-interest}

This object can be created in the Map Viewer as well as the Top Viewer. It records one or more locations, each one with a unique name. This pre-recorded location list can be selected in the Data Comparator or any algorithm with a preview. A good usage case is to record the locations of gathers showing issues (multiple, residual move-out etc) using a QC attribute map and use them as an input for testing algorithms, and for comparing results afterwards.

To create a Locations of Interest list, right click on the Map Viewer and choose **Create Location of Interest.** Click on Control + Left Mouse Button to add locations to the current object. For each location, a prompt will ask for a name. Right click and choose **Finish Editing** to stop adding locations. You can add more locations later via **Edit** on a selected object or via the algorithm previews or Data Comparator.
