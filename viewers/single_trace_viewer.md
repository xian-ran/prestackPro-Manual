## Single Trace Viewer {#single-trace-viewer}

To look at a single trace of your volume go to **Viewer** → **Trace Viewer…** Data can be selected from the selection menu or using the blue probe. The viewer displays the trace along the time \(or depth\) dimension at a selected inline, crossline \(and offset/angle for prestack data\).
