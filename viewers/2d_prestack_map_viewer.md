## 2D PreStack Map Viewer {#2d-prestack-map-viewer}

The 2D Prestack Map Viewer allows the display of prestack attribute maps created from the [“create map” process](..\algorithm_documentation\interpretation-processing\horizon_toolkit\README.16.md), with amplitude values shown for ALL offsets/angles. Timeslices from a seismic volume can also be viewed.

The functionalities of this viewer are quite similar to the one described for the map viewer. The axes (inline/crossline) have scrollbar functionalities. This helps the spatially scaling of the map (offset vs. horizontal distance). Decimating of the gathers is also convenient for keeping a sensible inline/crossline aspect ratio. In the toolbar there are additional blue arrows that enable flipping of inline/crossline axis.
