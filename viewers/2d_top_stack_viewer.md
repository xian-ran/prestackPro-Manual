## 2D Top Stack Viewer {#2d-top-stack-viewer}

The version 3.6.0 introduces a new viewer called the Top Stack Viewer. It is the equivalent of the Stack viewer for horizontal slices as well as the display of attribute maps created from the Create Map process. You can display either single fold Map/slices as well as a constant offset/angle plane of multi-fold Map/slices.

The aim of that viewer is to allow quick comparisons between datasets. It shares several functionalities with the Map Viewer but also removes some of its limitations, while having its own. The table below compares the two viewers.

| **Map View** | **Top View** |
| --- | --- |
| ** ** |   |

The functionalities of this viewer are similar to the one described in the gather viewer. All maps of the same geometry will show in the same viewer and the angle/offset selection is propagated to all maps.
