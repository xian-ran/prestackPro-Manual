### Introduction {#introduction}

This application displays well logs, seismic gathers and stacks, and synthetic gathers.

Seismic and synthetic data are displayed as wiggle traces only. All gather traces are shown. However, for stacks, only 21 inline/xline traces will be displayed, centered around the selected X/Y location.

A reference well, gives MD / TVD / TWT scales, and tops, zones and facies for the Well Log Viewer – usually set automatically as the well from the first log displayed.

Multi-well log displays are possible within one viewer or by syncing several well log viewers. The TWT vertical scale of a Well Log Viewer and Seismic viewer can be sync’d also. To see the TWT scale in the Well log Viewer, add a TWT scale beside MD/TVD scale bars, using the scale bar MB3 context menu and make it the linear scale, by dragging it to be the first scale bar from the left.

Well Log Viewer allows the Q.C. and analysis of gather synthetics -

: by visualisation of logs and synthetics with real gathers,

: by comparing different Vp/Vs/rho log sets and their synthetics

- eg: brine, oil, gas

Also facies zone creation (Vp/Vs/rho classes) is enabled within the application, ready for input to Pcube inversion &amp; crossplots.
