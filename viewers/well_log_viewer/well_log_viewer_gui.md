### Well Log Viewer GUI {#well-log-viewer-gui}

Well Log Viewer - showing 3 Log Tracks, from the 30/10-2 reference well.

**Logs** can be displayed in their own track, by simply dragging and dropping them from the middle, well log tree, into the empty part of the display area.

They will be displayed using their default min-max range, set on import or by the user in Well Log Viewer, via the log track header context menu.

A log can be added to an existing track by dragging it into the track rather than the empty area.

**Track Vertical pan &amp; zoom** is by mouse wheel and drag in log/seismic display or MD/TVD/TWT scale bars. Double click in a scale track allows manual setting of the vertical range.

**Track Horizontal pan &amp; zoom** is by mouse wheel and drag in log/seismic track header only. Min/Max line setting, for this display, is by header MB3, context menu **Set display range....**.

**Logarithmic scale** can be set by header MB3, context menu **Logarithmic scale**.

**Create Zones :** **Add new log zone** from the Zones Tab context menu, gives the user the chance to define a log zone using a number of cascaded filters. There are 5 types to choose from the drop down menu shown below.

The last filter, by **Cross plot polygon**, allows the use of a cross plot polygon to define log zones and thereby Pcube facies.

Add new log zone - defined by a Vsand log range and 2 tops

**Create facies :** MB3, context menu, on a zone name, allows **Create facies from zone....**.Vp, Vs and density logs can be selected, and the zone is used to filter log depth samples for membership of the new Pcube facies.

**Seismic** volumes from the data Pool, can be displayed in their own track, by the same drag and drop. The default location is the top well inline/xline location. The seismic track header, context menu, allows the user to change this to any map location, using the usual pipette or manual input methods.

Change the amplitude reference value, in the Track configuration window, to a user defined value, if you want to make subtle amplitude comparisons between datasets â€“ the default 3 * Std deviation could hide amplitude differences.
