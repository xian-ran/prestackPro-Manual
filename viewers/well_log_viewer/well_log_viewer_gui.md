### Well Log Viewer GUI {#well-log-viewer-gui}

_Well Log Viewer - showing 3 Log Tracks, from the 30/10-2 reference well._

**Logs **can be displayed in their own track by simply dragging and dropping them from the well log tree into the empty part of the display area. They will be displayed using their default min-max range set on import. To change the range go to the log track header context menu. A log can be added to an existing track by dragging it into the track rather than the empty area. By default, log display is not restricted to the depth of the reference well path. It is possible to enable this restriction via the axis context menu.

Tracks can be moved laterally by clicking on the arrows icon on the top of each track.

_Track coznfiguration settings_

The **Track configuration settings** is invoked from the context menu on a track. The curve style, curve line width, color and symbols can be applied either to one or all logs.

**Track Vertical pan & zoom** is by mouse wheel and drag in log/seismic display or MD/TVD/TWT scale bars. Double click in a scale track allows manual setting of the vertical range.

**Track Horizontal pan & zoom** is by mouse wheel and drag in log/seismic track header only. Min/Max line setting, for this display, is by header MB3, context menu **Set display range...**

**Logarithmic scale** can be set by header MB3, context menu **Logarithmic scale**.

**Tops **and **Zones **can be turned on

in the Log tracks, by selection in Tops or Zones Tab. New Tops can be picked using the MB3 log track data context menu. New zones, created by MB3 Zones Tab tree list, context menu.

In the Tops tab, under the list of tops there are two icons respectively to save the visible tops to the global setting display for the master well and to load and apply the settings for the master well.

**Create Zones:  Add new log zone** from the Zones Tab context menu to define a log zone using a number of cascaded filters. There are 5 types to choose from the drop-down menu shown below.

The last filter, by **Cross plot polygon**, allows the use of a cross plot polygon to define log zones and thereby Pcube facies.

_Add new log zone -  defined by a Vsand log range and 2 tops_

**Create facies:**   MB3 context menu on a zone name, allows **Create facies from zone...**  Vp, Vs and density logs can be selected and scaled if necessary, and the zone is used to filter log depth samples for membership of the new Pcube facies.

**Seismic **volumes from the data Pool, can be displayed in their own track, by the same drag and drop action. The default location is the top well inline/xline location. The seismic track header context menu allows the user to change this to any map location, using the usual pipette or manual input methods.

Change the amplitude reference value in the **Track configuration** window to a user defined value if you want to make subtle amplitude comparisons between datasets. The default of 3 _ Std deviation could hide amplitude differences. It is also possible to restrict the angle range displayed in the **Track configuration** window for pre-stack volumes. The T\*rack configuration_ is invoked from the context menu of a track, or by a double-clicking inside the track.

_A defined log set with three member logs_

Defined log sets can be found under the **Log sets** tab.

Below the defined log set, the member logs are shown.

By dragging and dropping the log set into the display area, the user gets the option to add all logs in one track or in separate tracks.

It is possible to drag and drop separate log members into the display area.
